This extension is not actively supported anymore. I've moved away from TYPO3 development for various reasons. Just keeping up with the latest changes just for the development of T3Chimp has become unmanagable and thus I have decided to stop the support. Pull requests are still welcome and I will integrate them if possible. If you're interested in taking over the development of T3Chimp drop me a message on http://matoilic.ch.
